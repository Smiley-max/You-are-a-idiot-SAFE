# YOU ARE AN IDIOT (NO VIRUS EDITION)

Welcome to the **You Are An Idiot** revival â€“ a loud, looping, goofy piece of internet history. This README is long, ridiculous, and written with the chaotic spirit of the early 2000s. Buckle up.

---

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?

This is a completely safe, no-popup, no-virus recreation of the legendary "you are an idiot" Flash animation. Originally designed to be annoying and chaotic (and sometimes dangerous), this modern version keeps the fun while dropping the harmful stuff.

Itâ€™s a web page. It plays a looping GIF. It plays a looping MP3. Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the magic.

---

## WHY WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?

Great question.

Because the internet used to be a weird, wild place.  
Because memes have ancestors.  
Because nostalgia is strong.  
Because "idiot.gif" is iconic.  
Because Flash is dead and we miss it.  
Because why not.

You might want to use this for:

- A school project about old internet culture  
- A joke for a friend (a nice one)  
- A retro-style art installation  
- Just having fun  
- Learning how audio loops work in HTML  
- Exploring chaotic design from a safer time  

---

## WHAT DOES THIS INCLUDE?

This project consists of only three files:

- `index.html` â€“ the main webpage that runs the show  
- `idiot.gif` â€“ the glorious, pixelated animation of yesteryear  
- `idiot.mp3` â€“ the looping audio that lives rent-free in your brain  

No frameworks.  
No libraries.  
No nonsense.  
Just pure, distilled chaos.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN IT?

When you open `index.html` in your browser:

1. The screen turns white.
2. The GIF appears in the middle.
3. The MP3 starts playing.
4. When the sound ends, it starts again.
5. Forever.

Unless you close the tab.  
Or throw your laptop.  
Or unplug the speakers.  
Or re-evaluate your life decisions.  

---

## IS THIS SAFE?

Yes.  
Very.  
No hidden scripts.  
No unexpected popups.  
No redirects.  
No malware.  
No mystery.  

You are in control. Unlike the original.

## WHAT'S NOT INCLUDED?

- Popups flying everywhere  
- Browser hijacking  
- Crashes  
- Spyware  
- Registry edits  
- Anything illegal

## WHY IS THIS README SO LONG?

Because the original "you are an idiot" was short, but it stuck with you forever. This README does the opposite. It is long. It is loud. It is lovingly stupid.

Sometimes, the internet needs less optimization and more chaos.  
More pixels. More loops. More ridiculous text.  
No links. No help. Just fun.

## CREDITS

No official credits.

This is a fan project.  
A digital art piece.  
A time capsule.  
A glitch in the timeline.  
A screaming smiley.  
A tribute.

If you made the original, thank you.  
If you didnâ€™t, youâ€™re still cool.  
If youâ€™re reading this far, youâ€™re dedicated.
